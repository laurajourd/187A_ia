                  Mary is a stay-at-home mom, although recently she began taking
                  online classes to brush up on her accounting skills. She has served
                  as the President of the Booster Club at her children's
                  high school for the last three years, and she was Treasurer of the
                  Parents' Association before that. </p>

              <p>
                  Having already sent three of her four children off to college,
                  Mary knows this process can be confusing and stressful. She believes
                  that choosing the right college is a critical first step toward
                  adulthood, but, as any parent knows, it's always a little hard
                  to let them go. </p>

              <p>
                  Her top concerns are finances, campus health and safety, and
                  career services.
