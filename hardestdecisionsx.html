            <div class="content">
                <h3 style="text-align:left">Main Navigation</h3>
                <p class="placement">
                    Our goal was to create a clear and efficient top level structure which would encompass
                    the wide variety of information on the website without overwhelming the user with too much
                    information.
                    We chose to limit our navigation bar to 6 different labels.
                    Of the websites we explored in our
                    <a href="competitiveanalysis.html#main" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a>,
                    the average number of labels on the main navigation is 6-7, including direct links.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Home</b>:
                    In our competitive analysis, we found only one instance of this label in the top navigation--on the
                    University of Indianapolis website. However, we chose to include this because we thought
                    it was an important criterion in terms of usability. We remembered the power of Nielsen's
                    "User Control and Freedom" heuristic, which states:
                    "users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked 'emergency exit'
                    to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue."
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>About / Admissions / Academics</b>:
                    These next three labels were not difficult to choose.
                    Each of these labels were found on all five universities we closely analyzed for comparison.
                    "About" and "Academics" are also labels on the present UL Lafayette website. The "Prospective
                    Students" portal on the UL Lafayette website acts their "Admissions" page at the moment, which
                    does not give immediate visibility to a core concern in the context of a university website.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Campus Life</b>:
                    None of our comparison university websites used "Student Life," which is the label on the current
                    UL Lafayette website. Instead, four out of five use the term "Campus Life," and Washington
                    State University is more specific with "WSU Life." We decided to use "Campus Life" not only
                    because of this observation but also because we thought it was a more general term that would
                    appeal to more user groups and give us more flexibility for topics to include on our
                    second level page. For instance, instead of inserting "Athletics" on the main navigation, we
                    include it on the secondary level page under "Campus Life." This incorporates not only the
                    recreational programs for students, but also those available to faculty, staff, and members
                    of the community.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Research</b>:
                    This label is included on the main navigation of only three of our comparison websites,
                    and also the current UL Lafayette site. The research field at a university is an important
                    part of the community, as well as the university's reputation. Especially in consideration
                    of users like Nicolas, our postdoctoral researcher, we realized it is important to be able
                    to access the research page directly from the main navigation.
                </p>
                
                
                <p class="placement">We tried to follow a logical order for the placement of our main navigation items.
                    Seven of the eight websites we used for our early competitive analysis place the "About" section
                    first, followed by either "Admissions" or "Academics" (or some variation of these two labels). The
                    exceptions are Oregon State University, which omits the "Admissions" sections, and the University
                    of Indianapolis, which, as stated above, starts with a "Home" link. 
                </p>
                <p class="placement">
                    Five of the eight place "Research" next. However, we chose to follow "Academics" with "Campus Life."
                    Although "Academics" and "Research" are indeed closely related topics, we decided that in the
                    perspective of a prospective student or parent, "Campus Life" would be the next logical
                    topic of interest. Having "Research" at the end of the navigation bar sets it apart in a way
                    that maintains the ease of access that we found so important, as described above, while not
                    disrupting what we considered to be a typical flow of activity for our core users.
                </p>

                <h3 style="text-align:left;margin-top:30px;">Secondary Level</h3>

                <p class="placement">
                    The more difficult decisions came with designing the secondary level of the information
                    architecture. Not only did we take into consideration the structure of the five websites
                    we closely analyzed for comparison and the concerns of our users, but we also utilized
                    our expertise from navigating the UL Lafayette website in the previous assignment. It was
                    important to us that the subnavigation items we chose to include accorded with the content
                    on the current UL Lafayette website. Our <a href="competitiveanalysis.html" target="_blank">
                    competitive analysis tables</a> neatly summarize the organization of the secondary level page
                    navigation for five comparison universities, the current UL Lafayette page, and our redesign.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>About</b>:
                    We noticed that the subheadings on the UL Lafayette "About" page encompassed a broad range of
                    topics, which the other five universities omitted from their secondary level page. The
                    challenge here was to configure appropriate groupings for this content. Most of these,
                    "Economic Impact" and "University Organizational Chart," for example, were topics which could be
                    grouped under "Administration," a subheading used by four of the five other universities
                    (Harvard's is titled "Harvard's President & Leadership"). From that point, choosing the other
                    subheadings became much less complicated.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Admissions</b>:
                    We organized this category according to type of student. Undergraduate and graduate were
                    obvious decisions. We included "International Students," with our user Charles in mind, since
                    international students often have specific concerns like visas and language requirements,
                    whether they be graduate or undergraduate applicants. It took a bit of digging into the
                    UL Lafayette website to find out about the summer visitor program and UL Lafayette's University
                    College, which is a non-degree for-credit enrollment option. University College is
                    separate from the "Continuing Education" program, which does not require an application.
                    Applying for scholarships and financial aid is also a crucial part of the admissions process.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Academics</b>:
                    We chose not to distinguish between undergraduate and graduate programs in this category.
                    Instead, we adhered to the university's academic organizational structure. UL Lafayette
                    is separated into various topic-based colleges, each of which house different departments
                    offering various degree programs. The "Graduate School" is actually the graduate admissions
                    and advising office, which, under our information architecture, should be included in the
                    third level, under "Academic Support Services." We included "Academic Calendar" and
                    "Current Course Offerings" because these are frequently used resources for prospective
                    and current students, as well as interested parents and visitors.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Campus Life</b>:
                    The current site's "Student Life" page redirects to the "Current Students" portal. We aimed to
                    create sub-categories that a more diverse group of users could find useful. The challenge here
                    was in limiting the number of sub-categories, since "Campus Life" can include a wide
                    variety of options, even among the other universities. Our strategy was to select the
                    common elements among the four universities (Harvard does not have this category)
                    we analysed closely, also keeping in mind the user personas and scenarios we created.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Research</b>:
                    Although the organization chosen by Washington State University was highly appealing to us,
                    our lack of understanding of the various research fields at UL Lafayette. The
                    organization of the current research site seemed haphazard and confusing to us.
                    Again, we used our competitive analysis to determine the standard elements, and
                    we also added "University Research Park," a unique research facility under UL Lafayette.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:30px;text-align:left">Layout Design</h3>
                <p class="placement1">To realize the layout/design of our Louisiana Lafayette website we used the ideas
                    of Bordeaux University website: <a
                            href="http://www.univ-bordeauxsegalen.fr/fr/index.html"><i>Link</i>.</a></p>

                <p class="placement1">We thought it was a new and interesting design respecting our objectives and
                    Information Architecture.
                    We have a simple layout with a main navigation bar, a gateways bar, and three different boxes
                    forward different links. In order to have some interactivity on the home page, we liked the idea to
                    add a gallery.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1">For the second level page we also copied the layout/design of Bordeaux University.
                    We realized 5 wireframes, corresponding to our main navigational labels, for the second level page.
                    We used the Axure software.</p>
