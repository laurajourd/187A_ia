            <div class="content">
                <p class="placement"><b>Our decisions For / Our Redesign For:</b></p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>- Main Navigation Bar -</b></p>

                <p class="placement1">We chose to have 6 different labels on our main navigation bar:</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Home: </b>The label home was finding only on University of Indianapolis website
                    but we thought it was an important criterion in term of usability. We remembered the power of the
                    "User Control and Freedom".
                    According to Nielsen, "users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked
                    "emergency exit" to leave the
                    unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue". That is why, we chose to insert
                    the label Home.</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>About: </b>We found this label on each University website (5/5). When the label
                    was on each page, we didn't
                    hesitate to incorporate
                    it in our main navigation bar. Moreover, it was also on the present Louisiana University website.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Academics / Admissions: </b>It was the same as above. In other words, the label
                    was on each main navigation bar of the 5 websites.</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Research: </b>The label research was only found on 3 websites. But when we
                    questioned a post doc. student for our User Personas,
                    we realized it should be important to access directly to the research page. The research field at
                    the University is an important part of the community.</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Campus Life: </b>: At present, Louisiana University website has Student Life
                    label. We found also this label on 4 of our websites. That's why,
                    we didn't hesitate. We called the label Campus Life instead of Student Life because it was more a
                    general term. It should be more convenient for our second level page.
                    For instance, we didn't insert the label Athletics on the main menu but in the second level page:
                    campus life. </p>

                <p class="placement1">To conclude, the choice of 6 items on the main navigational bar is not neutral. We
                    would not pervade the user with a lot of information.
                    The goal was to create something clear and efficient using a good organization.</p></br>
                <p class="placement1"><b>- Second Level Items -</b></p>

                <p class="placement1">For the second level items we carried out the same method. Look at first to the 5
                    different websites second level organization. After that we tried to find the better solution.
                    We picked some ideas in each different website in order for instance to rename or add our own
                    labels. </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>About: </b>We kept "President's message", "fast facts about Louisiana
                    Lafayette" and "University Organizational Chart". We changed the name of "Campus map" by "map and
                    direction",
                    which is more indicative. We put "history and mission" together instead of 2 different items.</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Acedemics: </b>We just look at the other websites and decided to keep almost
                    every thing as Louisiana without the "awards and recognition" and "Accreditation and accredited
                    programs"
                    labels which should be in the third level, section "Academic support for students". We added
                    "finances" item in academics section because we thought first it was an important label missing in
                    the second
                    level and it was a major part of the student's academics life. </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Admissions: </b>We thought about which person would be able to apply for an
                    academic session. That's why, we thought about "Undergraduate", "graduate students", "professional"
                    and "continuing education".
                    We had also "summer session" because it is a specific quarter or semester (different organization as
                    the other).</p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Research: </b>The choice for this section was a little confusing. We liked the
                    idea of Washington State University, to choose the label's name in function as the different
                    research field.
                    In other words, they choose the labels 'clean technologies' and 'Environment' for instance because
                    it was their research fields. The idea was interesting but we were incompetent to do the same
                    because we didn't know enough
                    the main research field at the Louisiana University. As a result, we decided to choose something
                    more conformists using our competitive analysis. </p>

                <p class="placement1"><b>Campus Life: </b>: Like referring above in the first part, we called the label
                    'Campus Life' instead of 'Student Life' because it was more a general term. We chose to present 8
                    different items.
                    We looked at the different labels in each website and picked the more meaningful. We imagined in a
                    real situation looking for a campus life, like we did for our fresh men year.</p>
                </br>
                <p class="placement1"><b>- Design of our Website -</b></p>

                <p class="placement1">To realize the layout/design of our Louisiana Lafayette website we used the ideas
                    of Bordeaux University website: <a
                            href="http://www.univ-bordeauxsegalen.fr/fr/index.html"><i>Link</i>.</a></p>

                <p class="placement1">We thought it was a new and interesting design respecting our objectives and
                    Information Architecture.
                    We have a simple layout with a main navigation bar, a gateways bar, and three different boxes
                    forward different links. In order to have some interactivity on the home page, we liked the idea to
                    add a gallery.
                </p>

                <p class="placement1">For the second level page we also copied the layout/design of Bordeaux University.
                    We realized 5 wireframes, corresponding to our main navigational labels, for the second level page.
                    We used the axure software.</p>
